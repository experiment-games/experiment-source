# Tags

To help categorize and organize content, we use tags. Tags are short keywords
that describe the content of a page.

## Special Tags

### `needs-verification`

To speed up development an AI assistant (GitHub Copilot) is used to generate
documentation. This tag is used to mark content that needs to be verified by a
human. This means:

- Arguments and return values may not work as described
- Functions may not be described correctly
- The argument name of a function may be incorrect

The amount of arguments and return values SHOULD be correct.

### `needs-example`

This tag is used to mark content that needs an example. You can help by
providing an example in the content of the page. See [Contributing](../portal/contributing.md)
for more information.
