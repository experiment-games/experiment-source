# The Basics (tutorial)

!!! Warning
    This tutorial is a work in progress. There is not much here yet.

This will guide you through the basics of Lua scripting in Experiment by creating:

- A simple script that launches all players into the air on command.
- Converting that script into a reusable function.
- Adding parameters to the function and command to control the launch height.
- Converting the script into an addon that can be shared with others.
