The `function` type is a data type that represents a block of code that can be
called by name.

Functions can be created using the `function` keyword followed by a list of
parameters and a block of code.

Functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from
other functions.

A function without a name is called an anonymous function.
