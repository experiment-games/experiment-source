# Bindings

When we say 'Lua bindings' we mean the functions, libraries, enumerations, classes and other features that are available to Lua scripts when running in Experiment.
The Source SDK 2013 normally only provides a C++ API that can be used to create mods for Source Engine games.
With Experiment we have added a Lua API that allows you to write scripts in Lua that interact with the Source Engine.

This way you can quickly prototype Source Engine mods without having to write any C++ code.
