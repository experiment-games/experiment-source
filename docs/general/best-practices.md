# Best Practices

Part of writing clean, efficient and maintainable code is following conventions.
This makes it easier for you and others to read and understand the code. Every
team or project may have their own conventions. What's important is that you
document them and try to stick to them.

Check out our [Conventions](./conventions.md) page for the conventions we follow
in Experiment.
