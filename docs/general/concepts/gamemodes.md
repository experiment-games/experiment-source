# Gamemodes

Gamemodes define the core rules of gameplay. Like addons, they are structured similarly but focus on defining mechanics rather than adding extra assets. A server can only run one gamemode at a time.

You can specify the gamemode to run using the `gamemode` console command or `+gamemode` launch option.
