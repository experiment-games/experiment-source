# Addons

An addon is a self-contained package of content and scripts that expands the game. Addons are placed in `<experiment directory>/addons`, where they override or supplement the base game files. Addons can contain:

- Scripts

- Materials

- Models

- Sounds

- And more content


The directory structure inside an addon mirrors the main game directory. You can imagine every addon that is loaded as being "overlaid" or "merged" with the main game directory. This means that if an addon contains a file that is also present in the main game directory, the addon's file will be used instead.
