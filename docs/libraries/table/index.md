# Table Library

The `table` library is a standard Lua library that provides a functions for
table manipulation.

Original functions have non-capitalized names, e.g: `table.insert`, while our
additional functions have UpperCamelCase names, e.g: `table.Copy`.

Read more on the standard Lua debug library [in the Lua
PIL](https://www.lua.org/pil/19.html) or [in the Lua 5.4 Reference
Manual](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/manual.html#6.6).
