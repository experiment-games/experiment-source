It allowed us to get a head start in implementing Lua scripting support in the Source Engine.</p> <p>With code from that great project we continued work on getting the Experiment Redux gamemode to work in our Source Engine mod. Our first big milestone was getting the Garry's Mod sandbox gamemode to load and run in our mod.</p> <p>From there we continued to add more and more features to our mod, and we are still working on it to this day.
