## Requirements

- Source SDK 2013 Multiplayer Base (Installed through Steam)
- Visual Studio 2022 (or newer)
- [Visual Studio 2013 (for the Source SDK 2013 solution)](https://archive.org/details/en_visual_studio_community_2013_with_update_5_x86_dvd_6816332)

[&raquo; See the Source SDK 2013 documentation for more information.](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_SDK_2013)

## Getting started

1. Go into the `src/` directory and generate the Visual Studio solution.

    ```bash
    cd src
    creategameprojects.bat
    ```

2. Open the created `experiment.sln` solution in Visual Studio 2022 (or newer).

    > [!WARNING]
    > Despite building in Visual Studio 2022, the Source SDK 2013 solution requires Visual Studio 2013 to be installed.

3. Build the solution in `Release` mode.

4. After the build is complete make a symlink from the `game/experiment` directory to your `steamapps/sourcemods` directory. E.g:

    ```bash
    mklink /J "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods\experiment" "<path to this repo>\game\experiment"
    ```

5. To setup the game mod directory, run:

    ```bash
    ./tools/setup-game.sh
    ```
